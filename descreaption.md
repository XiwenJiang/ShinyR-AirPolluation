## Description 

### What is AQI?

AQI(air quality index) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. 

### How does the AQI work?

Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.

For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration that equals the level of the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher.

### What does the data comes from?
The US state department has recorded and published hourly. User could find the exact dataset from United States Environmental Protection Agency website.

### What is this app?
This app allows you to look at trends in pollution levels in the U.S. for each year (2011 - 2020) that there is available data. It includes a graph of daily averages and a table showing various monthly summary statistics at county level, and the U.S. map to visualize the monthly average air pollution at states level. 

### How to use this app?

* Map: Visualize the air pollution from the U.S. map with states level. 
* Descriptive statistics: Visualize the air pollution trend and get a summary table to see the details with the specific state, county, and time interval.
